// You need to develop the game Snake. What data structures will you use? Code your solution.
// kth largest element in array
// Find minimum number of steps to reach the end of array from start
// Median of stream of numbers

// Given a source array of integers with possible duplicates and a target integer, write algorithm to find out 2 numbers in source array whose sum is equal to target integer.
// Which is faster: finding an item in a hashtable or in a sorted list? And Why?
